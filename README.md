# License-Plate-Recognition

ABSTRACT: -

By this project, we are having many advantages in our day to day life. Like it can be used in tollbooth for automatic number plate recognition with the camera photographs, car parking, traffic rules violations by simply a photograph of the car and its number plate.

Using methods like image fusion and neural networks and threshold techniques along with some experimental results for recognizing the number plate.

Introduction: -

By using the MATLAB software, we are going to create an automatic system to detect and recognize the number plate of the vehicles.

Basically, an image is taken and processed by using some algorithms in MATLAB and output can be extracted in a string form or any other group of characters for our easy understanding. By using optical character recognition on images to read number plates of the vehicles.



Problem definition: -

As we have said earlier, the main focus of our project is to recognize the characters in an image. We chose this project as this helps the society in many ways.

I.	Recognition of traffic rules violating vehicles will be easy.

II.	Tracking of vehicles used by anti-social groups.

III.	Invalid license holders can be caught.

IV.	Helps in the tollbooths for quick transactions also.




Working principle: -

➢	An image is needed to perform the following tasks.

➢	Edge enhancement followed by morphological operators to extract the required region.

➢	And now with the help of optical recognition, we can get the number or the string in the text file.
 
Requirements: -

o	COMPUTER SYSTEM, MATLAB SOFTWARE and an IMAGE.
